## Description:
- Ultimate64.exe is for a 64-bit Windows platform (Windows 10 preferred)
- Ultimate.exe is for a 32-bit Windows platform (Windows XP preferred)

## Latest:
- This new version is [Lean 1.0.0-rc1 Specification](https://www.fysnet.net/leanfs/specification.php) compliant, with many improvements, updates, and fixes.
- However, since the new version of Lean is not close enough to being backward compatible, the app will no longer try to update your existing Lean Volumes to the new version.  You will have to create a new empty Lean 1.0.0 volume and add the files again.
- I have tried to fix all function of the Lean part of this app. Please let me know if you find something that doesn't work correctly.
